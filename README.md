This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

I still need to figure out the best approach to this challenge. The solution I came up with only works sometimes, other times it may error out (refreshing the page gets passed it). 
Im sure the issue is with the way I'm using getServerSideProps and the way that function handles page render

To run the development server:

```bash
cd bigcommerce-front-end-challenge
npm install
```
after all dependencies are installed

``` bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
